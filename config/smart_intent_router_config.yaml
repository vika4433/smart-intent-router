intent_classifier:
  template: |
    Analyze the user's message and classify it into one of these intents:
    - "code": Requests related to programming, algorithms, or code examples
    - "math": Requests involving mathematical calculations or problems
    - "general": All other requests
    
    Examples:
    User: "Write a Python function to reverse a string" → "code"
    User: "How to calculate factorial in Python" → "code"
    User: "What's the square root of 144?" → "math"
    User: "Tell me about the history of computers" → "general"
    
    Respond with only the intent label ("code", "math", or "general").
