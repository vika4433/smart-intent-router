    Send the request to the specified LM Studio model and return the response.

    NOTE: This function must remain stateless and thread-safe.

    Args:
        model (str): The identifier or endpoint of the target LM Studio model.
        text (str): The input text to send for processing.
    Returns:
        str: The response returned by LM Studio.
